# Sprinting
> An amazing JavaScript library for drawing things with canvas, with game-like features sprinkled in. Made for both beginners and advanced users.
> _Release 0.2.1 Alpha_

Sprinting allows you to draw things using _canvas_ with **a higher-level OOP API** that has game-like features (such as draw loop support) built-in out-of-the-box.

_Sprinting_ also allows for a simplified 'designing' experience, **using your browser's DOM inspector as a level editor of sorts**. You can modify the x position of your _Rectangle_ by simply changing it's _x_ attribute in the DOM - however this doesn't pull down performance (the DOM has always been _slow_) due to a simple _onblur_ check to only edit the DOM when the game isn't running. **You won't realise how awesome and helpful this feature is until you [try it](http://nanalan.github.io/sprinting/examples/basic)!**
